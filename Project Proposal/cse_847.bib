The large number of genetic factors poses both computational and statistical challenges. Various computational approaches have been developed for large scale GWAS. In this chapter, we will discuss several widely used computational approaches in GWAS. The following topics will be covered: (1) An introduction to the background of GWAS. (2) The existing computational approaches that are widely used in GWAS. This will cover single-locus, epistasis detection, and machine learning methods that have been recently developed in biology, statistic, and computer science communities. This part will be the main focus of this chapter. (3) The limitations of current approaches and future directions.},

	doi = {10.1002/gepi.20331},
	abstract = {The interpretation of the results of large association studies encompassing much or all of the human genome faces the fundamental statistical problem that a correspondingly large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms markers will be spuriously flagged as significant. A common method of dealing with these false positives is to raise the significance level for the individual tests for association of each marker. Any such adjustment for multiple testing is ultimately based on a more or less precise estimate for the actual overall type I error probability. We estimate this probability for association tests for correlated markers and show that it depends in a nonlinear way on the significance level for the individual tests. This dependence of the effective number of tests is not taken into account by existing multiple-testing corrections, leading to widely overestimated results. We demonstrate a simple correction for multiple testing, which can easily be calculated from the pairwise correlation and gives far more realistic estimates for the effective number of tests than previous formulae. The calculation is considerably faster than with other methods and hence applicable on a genome-wide scale. The efficacy of our method is shown on a constructed example with highly correlated markers as well as on real data sets, including a full genome scan where a conservative estimate only 8\% above the permutation estimate is obtained in about 1\% of computation time. As the calculation is based on pairwise correlations between markers, it can be performed at the stage of study design using public databases.},

	abstract = {An important task in personalized medicine is to predict disease risk based on a person’s genome, e.g. on a large number of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) make SNP and phenotype data available to researchers. A critical question for researchers is how to best predict disease risk. Penalized regression equipped with variable selection, such as LASSO and SCAD, is deemed to be promising in this setting. However, the sparsity assumption taken by the LASSO, SCAD and many other penalized regression techniques may not be applicable here: it is now hypothesized that many common diseases are associated with many SNPs with small to moderate effects. In this article, we use the GWAS data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) to investigate the performance of various unpenalized and penalized regression approaches under true sparse or non-sparse models. We find that in general penalized regression outperformed unpenalized regression; SCAD, TLP and LASSO performed best for sparse models, while elastic net regression was the winner, followed by ridge, TLP and LASSO, for non-sparse models.},

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker's variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers.},

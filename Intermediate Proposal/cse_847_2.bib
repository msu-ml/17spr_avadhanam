	abstract = {Mixed models have been used extensively in quantitative genetics to study continuous and discrete traits. A standard quantitative genetic model proposes that the effects of levels of some random factor (e.g., sire) are correlated accordingly with their relationships. For this reason, routines for mixed models available in standard packages cannot be used for genetic analysis. The pedigreemm package of R was developed as an extension of the lme4 package, and allows mixed models with correlated random effects to be fitted for Gaussian, binary, and count responses. Following the method of Harville and Callanan (1989), a correlation between levels of the grouping factor (e.g., sire) is induced by post-multiplying the incidence matrix of the levels of this random factor by the Cholesky factor of the corresponding (co)variance matrix (e.g., the numerator relationship matrix between sires). Estimation methods available in pedigreemm include approximations to maximum likelihood and {REML}. This note describes the classes of models that can be fitted using pedigreemm and presents examples that illustrate its use.},

	abstract = {Fitness and fertility traits of dairy cattle are of increasing importance and are often measured on a discrete scale. The development and application of generalized linear mixed models to the genetic analysis of these traits are reviewed. Because current genetic evaluation systems are predominantly based on animal models, the inferential challenges of highly parameterized generalized linear mixed models are discussed. Development and adoption of new methods for drawing appropriate inferences on dispersion parameters are essential. Recent hierarchical extensions have been proposed for generalized linear mixed models, allowing for complex dispersion patterns that accommodate heteroscedasticity and outlier robustness. Steady advances in available computing power have facilitated multiple-trait analyses involving continuous and discrete measures. Full Bayesian inference via the development of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods will continue to allow even greater generality and dimensions in the genetic model.},

	abstract = {Inbreeding coefficients of animals are required in many genetic analyses of livestock records. A modification of Colleau's indirect algorithm to compute inbreeding coefficients in large populations is presented. With overlapping generations, the modified algorithm evaluated all progeny of each sire simultaneously in one back and forth exploration of a reduced pedigree. Simulation for a relatively large number of generations, different number of sires, family sizes and mating designs showed that Colleau's algorithm was faster (from 1.2 to 143 times) than two other algorithms under comparison (Tier, modified Meuwissen and Luo), in all situations investigated. Modifying Colleau's algorithm considerably decreased computation time (from 50 to 89\%), resulting in a very fast algorithm. The number of sires mostly affected computational efficiency of the modified algorithm, whereas family size and mating design had virtually no effect. In the updating situation, when only animals born in the last year were evaluated, given known inbreeding coefficients for the other, the modified algorithm was also fast compared with the other three algorithms. Memory requirements for the algorithms were also discussed.},

	abstract = {Maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood ({REML}) estimates of the parameters in linear mixed-effects models can be determined using the lmer function in the lme4 package for R. As for most model-fitting functions in R, the model is described in an lmer call by a formula, in this case including both fixed- and random-effects terms. The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled {REML} criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or {REML} criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

	abstract = {The interpretation of the results of large association studies encompassing much or all of the human genome faces the fundamental statistical problem that a correspondingly large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms markers will be spuriously flagged as significant. A common method of dealing with these false positives is to raise the significance level for the individual tests for association of each marker. Any such adjustment for multiple testing is ultimately based on a more or less precise estimate for the actual overall type I error probability. We estimate this probability for association tests for correlated markers and show that it depends in a nonlinear way on the significance level for the individual tests. This dependence of the effective number of tests is not taken into account by existing multiple-testing corrections, leading to widely overestimated results. We demonstrate a simple correction for multiple testing, which can easily be calculated from the pairwise correlation and gives far more realistic estimates for the effective number of tests than previous formulae. The calculation is considerably faster than with other methods and hence applicable on a genome-wide scale. The efficacy of our method is shown on a constructed example with highly correlated markers as well as on real data sets, including a full genome scan where a conservative estimate only 8\% above the permutation estimate is obtained in about 1\% of computation time. As the calculation is based on pairwise correlations between markers, it can be performed at the stage of study design using public databases.},

Genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) make {SNP} and phenotype data available to researchers. A critical question for researchers is how to best predict disease risk. Penalized regression equipped with variable selection, such as {LASSO} and {SCAD}, is deemed to be promising in this setting. However, the sparsity assumption taken by the {LASSO}, {SCAD} and many other penalized regression techniques may not be applicable here: it is now hypothesized that many common diseases are associated with many {SNPs} with small to moderate effects. In this article, we use the {GWAS} data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium ({WTCCC}) to investigate the performance of various unpenalized and penalized regression approaches under true sparse or non-sparse models. We find that in general penalized regression outperformed unpenalized regression; {SCAD}, {TLP} and {LASSO} performed best for sparse models, while elastic net regression was the winner, followed by ridge, {TLP} and {LASSO}, for non-sparse models.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women in worldwide including Japan. Several studies have identified common genetic variants to be associated with the risk of breast cancer. Due to the complex linkage disequilibrium structure and various environmental exposures in different populations, it is essential to identify variants associated with breast cancer in each population, which subsequently facilitate the better understanding of mammary carcinogenesis. In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study ({GWAS}) as well as whole-genome imputation with 2,642 cases and 2,099 unaffected female controls. We further examined 13 suggestive loci (P{\textless}1.0×10−5) using an independent sample set of 2,885 cases and 3,395 controls and successfully validated two previously-reported loci, rs2981578 (combined P-value of 1.31×10−12, {OR} = 1.23; 95\% {CI} = 1.16–.30) on chromosome 10q26 ({FGFR}2), rs3803662 (combined P-value of 2.79×10−11, {OR} = 1.21; 95\% {CI} = 1.15–.28) and rs12922061 (combined P-value of 3.97×10−10, {OR} = 1.23; 95\% {CI} = 1.15–.31) on chromosome 16q12 ({TOX}3-{LOC}643714). Weighted genetic risk score on the basis of three significantly associated variants and two previously reported breast cancer associated loci in East Asian population revealed that individuals who carry the most risk alleles in category 5 have 2.2 times higher risk of developing breast cancer in the Japanese population than those who carry the least risk alleles in reference category 1. Although we could not identify additional loci associated with breast cancer, our study utilized one of the largest sample sizes reported to date, and provided genetic status that represent the Japanese population. Further local and international collaborative study is essential to identify additional genetic variants that could lead to a better, accurate prediction for breast cancer.},

This approach allows integrating various parametric and nonparametric shrinkage and variable selection procedures in a unified and consistent manner. The {BGLR} R-package implements a large collection of Bayesian regression models, including parametric variable selection and shrinkage methods and semiparametric procedures (Bayesian reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regressions, {RKHS}). The software was originally developed for genomic applications; however, the methods implemented are useful for many nongenomic applications as well. The response can be continuous (censored or not) or categorical (either binary or ordinal). The algorithm is based on a Gibbs sampler with scalar updates and the implementation takes advantage of efficient compiled C and Fortran routines. In this article we describe the methods implemented in {BGLR}, present examples of the use of the package, and discuss practical issues emerging in real-data analysis.},

We describe a statistical framework, the Bayesian generalized additive model (({BGAM}), and present software for integrating multilayer high-dimensional inputs into risk-assessment models. We used {BGAM} and data from The Cancer Genome Atlas for the analysis and prediction of survival after diagnosis of breast cancer. We developed a sequence of studies to (1) compare predictions based on single omics with those based on clinical covariates commonly used for the assessment of breast cancer patients ({COV}), (2) evaluate the benefits of combining {COV} and omics, (3) compare models based on (a) {COV} and gene expression profiles from oncogenes with (b) {COV} and whole-genome gene expression ({WGGE}) profiles, and (4) evaluate the impacts of combining multiple omics and their interactions. We report that (1) {WGGE} profiles and whole-genome methylation ({METH}) profiles offer more predictive power than any of the {COV} commonly used in clinical practice (e.g., subtype and stage), (2) adding {WGGE} or {METH} profiles to {COV} increases prediction accuracy, (3) the predictive power of {WGGE} profiles is considerably higher than that based on expression from large-effect oncogenes, and (4) the gain in prediction accuracy when combining multiple omics is consistent. Our results show the feasibility of omic integration and highlight the importance of {WGGE} and {METH} profiles in breast cancer, achieving gains of up to 7 points area under the curve ({AUC}) over the {COV} in some cases.},

	abstract = {Although recent genome-wide studies have provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of human disease, they have explained relatively little of the heritability of most complex traits, and the variants identified through these studies have small effect sizes. This has led to the important and hotly debated issue of where the 'missing heritability' of complex diseases might be found. Here, seven leading geneticists offer their opinion about where this heritability is likely to lie, what this could tell us about the underlying genetic architecture of common diseases and how this could inform research strategies for uncovering genetic risk factors.},

They provide a practical and principled approach to learning how a large number of genetic variants are associated with complex phenotypes, to help reveal the complexity in the relationship between the genetic markers and the outcome of interest. In this review, we highlight the potential key role it will have in modern genomic data processing, especially with regard to integration with classical methods for gene prioritizing, prediction and data fusion.},

	abstract = {The number of publications performing genome-wide association studies ({GWAS}) has increased dramatically. Penalized regression approaches have been developed to overcome the challenges caused by the high dimensional data, but these methods are relatively new in the {GWAS} field. In this study we have compared the statistical performance of two methods (the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator—lasso and the elastic net) on two simulated data sets and one real data set from a 50 K genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism ({SNP}) panel of 5570 Fleckvieh bulls. The first simulated data set displays moderate to high linkage disequilibrium between {SNPs}, whereas the second simulated data set from the {QTLMAS} 2010 workshop is biologically more complex. We used cross-validation to find the optimal value of regularization parameter λ with both minimum {MSE} and minimum {MSE} + 1SE of minimum {MSE}. The optimal λ values were used for variable selection. Based on the first simulated data, we found that the {minMSE} in general picked up too many {SNPs}. At {minMSE} + 1SE, the lasso didn't acquire any false positives, but selected too few correct {SNPs}. The elastic net provided the best compromise between few false positives and many correct selections when the penalty weight α was around 0.1. However, in our simulation setting, this α value didn't result in the lowest {minMSE} + 1SE. The number of selected {SNPs} from the {QTLMAS} 2010 data was after correction for population structure 82 and 161 for the lasso and the elastic net, respectively. In the Fleckvieh data set after population structure correction lasso and the elastic net identified from 1291 to 1966 important {SNPs} for milk fat content, with major peaks on chromosomes 5, 14, 15, and 20. Hence, we can conclude that it is important to analyze {GWAS} data with both the lasso and the elastic net and an alternative tuning criterion to minimum {MSE} is needed for variable selection.},
